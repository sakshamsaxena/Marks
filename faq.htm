<i><b>NOTE : Since the mid semester exams are being held a bit later than expected in September, the mid semester papers available here MIGHT not be sufficient as they would then be based on comparatively less syllabus (They were held from 9-14 September in 2013)</b></i>   
<br><br>
<span class="q">1) Where are the notes and stuff?</span><br><br>
Just click on the Downloads link and you will be directed to the repository of notes and papers hosted on One Drive. Everything is organized just like regular folders on a PC. You should be able to navigate easily. 
<br><br>
<span class="q">2) What is M.A.R.K.S. ?</span><br><br>
M.A.R.K.S. is an acronym for Most Amazing Resource of Knowledge for Students. Here you will find all the necessary material which will help you in your academics. M.A.R.K.S. is aimed to be reference resource ONLY and does not encourage complete dependency on third party resources on internet. That is why only that material is made available which would serve as reference and supplementary purposes only.
<br><br>
<span class="q">3) Why are you using One Drive? Why no direct links?</span><br><br>
It may seem weird to some people because such a practice is unheard of. The major reason for uploading on a central repository is that it makes browsing and downloading file(s) much easier as you can easily customize your download according to your need. Yes, the experience may be new to many, but it would provide more accessibility when downloading content. The only possible drawback of this is that none of the files would turn up in any web search results as they are made available only through the link provided here. This means that for fastest access to the files, simply bookmark the link to One Drive and then you can skip visiting the site, if you wish.
<br><br>
<span class="q">4) Why is 'Papers' and 'Notes' written below subjects?</span><br><br>
It identifies those subjects whose material is available under that category, i.e., it indicates whether the Question Papers or Notes or both are available for that subject. 
<br><br>
<span class="q">5) What is Mech C?</span><br><br>
Short-form for Mechanical Canteen. To its left is the only photocopy shop in campus, which is referred to here as the place to buy notes from. 
<br><br>
<span class="q">6) The animation is not properly rolling/ things look jumbled and weird. What's happening?</span><br><br>
The only explanation would be that your browser failed to load the scripts properly. This generally happens if your internet connection is working intermittently, or you are using too much bandwidth already so that your browser is not able to get bandwidth to access this site. Refresh the site after freeing some bandwidth and it should work fine.
<br><br>
<span class="q">7) The animation doesn't always rolls when I visit the site. What's happening?</span><br><br>
It is hard-coded feature of this site. The animations will roll when you first visit this site, or after you have cleared your browser cache. After that, the site will load with skipped animation. This feature is added to save your time when visiting again. 
To view them again, clear your cache and visit again. It will roll then. 
<br><br>
<span class="q">8) The notes aren't helping me. What do I do now?</span><br><br>
This is the most asked question. The notes might not be helpful for some students as they generally vary from batch to batch. The best solution in such cases is to refer to your classmates' notes. That's actually what we did and hence ultimately uploaded them here because we found them pretty useful. 
The other solution would be to buy notes from Photocopy shop of Mech C. 
<br><br>
<span class="q">9) One of e Books has some pages missing. What do I do?</span><br><br>
Well that's just sad. Honestly, I haven't gone through entire books but in such cases you will have to refer other copies of that book. Find them in library, borrow from a friend, or just rent it. 
<br><br>
<span class="q">10) The handwritten notes are heavy. It takes a lot of time to download. What do I do?</span><br><br>
Most people have poor internet connectivity and/or speed. This is actually a serious issue and the only solution would be to get it from someone who has already downloaded them.  
The quality of the material hosted here is not compromised with as that remained a priority in this initiative. Hence the file size will remain same, and no compressed copies of the same would be provided, because that wont be so clear always and you would eventually have to refer to "heavy" notes. Makes sense, no? 
<br><br>
<span class="q">11) I have something to add to this repository. How do I do that?</span><br><br>
Cool! Just <a href="mailto:saksham_saxena@outlook.com">email</a> me and we'll sort that out. 
<br><br>
<span class="q">12) I'm curious about the technical part of the site. How do I get to know more?</span><br><br>
